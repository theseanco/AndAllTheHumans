##...And All The Humans Will Be Eliminated

This is all of the code for the music behind the show '...And All The Humans Will Be Eliminated' by State of Grace

The music for the show is written and performed using SuperCollider, Tidal and SuperDirt. All applicable setup is in the 'Setupfile.scd' in 'Setup', which just needs cmd/ctrl+enter to activate (all samples and SynthDefs will automatically be loaded).

I have put all of the code used in the development of the show under 'Rehearsals', and the code i am using for the final show under 'Final'. Unfortunately I can't share my sample library due to Copyright, but a lot of the samples can be grabbed from the 'Samples' folder of my co34pt\_Livecode repo.

There are detailed staging directions going through the entire show.

I'll put a link to a recording of the show when one is available

State of Grace is:

Ben Ayrton, Lizzie Klotz, Charlie Dearnley, Peter Kerry-Forbes, Rosie Macari, Alys North, Alicia Colette Meehan and Sean Cotterill
